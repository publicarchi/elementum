## Ontologies académiques et bibliographiques

### The SPAR Ontologies

The SPAR Ontologies are a set of modular OWL 2 DL ontologies for for describing all the main aspects of publishing domain

In the past, several groups have proposed (Semantic Web) models, such as RDFS vocabularies and OWL ontologies, to describe particular aspects of the publishing domain. However, these models were mainly concerned with the description of the metadata of bibliographic resources (e.g., DC Terms, PRISM and BIBO). One of the first attempts to address the description of the whole publishing domain is the introduction of the Semantic Publishing and Referencing (SPAR) Ontologies. SPAR is a suite of orthogonal and complementary OWL 2 ontologies that enable all aspects of the publishing process to be described in machine-readable metadata statements, encoded using RDF.

### FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology (FaBiO)

http://purl.org/spar/fabio/

FaBiO, the FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology, is an ontology for recording and publishing on the Semantic Web bibliographic records of scholarly endeavours. It forms part of SPAR, a suite of Semantic Publishing and Referencing Ontologies. Other SPAR ontologies are described at http://purl.org/spar/. This ontology is available at http://purl.org/spar/fabio, and uses the namespace prefix fabio.


### Publishing Role Ontology (PRO)

http://purl.org/spar/pro/

PRO, the Publishing Roles Ontology, is an ontology for describing roles in the publication process, or in other scholarly activities or situations, held by particular agent. The role can be specified to exist over a defined period of time, and within a specific context, e.g. with respect to a particular document. PRO forms part of SPAR, a suite of Semantic Publishing and Referencing Ontologies. Other SPAR ontologies are described at http://purl.org/spar/.


### Bibliographic Reference Ontology (BiRO)

http://purl.org/spar/biro

BiRO, the Bibliographic Reference Ontology is an ontology for describing bibliographic records and references, and their compilation into bibliographic collections and reference lists. It forms part of SPAR, a suite of Semantic Publishing and Referencing Ontologies. Other SPAR ontologies are described at http://purl.org/spar/.


### Open Citations

http://opencitations.net
http://opencitations.net/ontology.html

OCO, the OpenCitations Ontology, is not yet another bibliographic ontology, rather it is just a place where existing and complementary ontological entities from several other ontologies are grouped together for the purpose of providing descriptive metadata for the [OpenCitations Corpus (OCC)](http://opencitations.net).

These ontologies mostly comes from SPAR


### W3C Ontology for Media Resources

https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaont-10/

This document defines the Ontology for Media Resources 1.0. The term "Ontology" is used in its broadest possible definition: a core vocabulary. The intent of this vocabulary is to bridge the different descriptions of media resources, and provide a core set of descriptive properties. This document defines a core set of metadata properties for media resources, along with their mappings to elements from a set of existing metadata formats. Besides that, the document presents a Semantic Web compatible implementation of the abstract ontology using RDF/OWL. The document is mostly targeted towards media resources available on the Web, as opposed to media resources that are only accessible in local repositories.



### VIVO ontology

VIVO, to represent the research and educational resources in an academic biomedical informatics department to enable ontology-based information storage and retrieval

VIVO is an open source application implementing semantic web principles and technologies to represent academic research communities. The VIVO ontology provides a set of types (classes) and relationships (properties) to represent researchers and the full context in which they work. Content in any local VIVO installation may be maintained manually, brought into VIVO in automated ways from local systems of record, such as HR, grants, course, and faculty activity databases, or from database providers such as publication aggregators and funding agencies.

The VIVO Ontology is based on other, including notably BIBO and FOAF.

## Digital humanities

### NeDiMAH Methods Ontology (NeMO)

http://nemo.dcu.gr

The NeDiMAH Methods Ontology (NeMO) is a comprehensive ontological model of scholarly practice in the arts and humanities, developed under the work plan of the ESF Research Network NeDiMAH.

NeMO is a CIDOC CRM - compliant ontology which explicitly addresses the interplay of factors of agency (actors and goals), process (activities and methods) and resources (information resources, tools, concepts) manifest in the scholarly process. It builds on the results of extensive empirical studies and modelling of scholarly practices performed by the Digital Curation Unit in projects DARIAH, EHRI and Europeana Cloud.

NeMO incorporates existing relevant taxonomies of scholarly methods and tools, such as TaDIRAH, the arts-humanities.net and Oxford taxonomies of ICT methods, DHCommons, CCC-IULA-UPF and DiRT, through appropriate mappings of the concepts defined therein onto a semantic backbone of NeMO concepts. It thus enables combining documentary elements on scholarly practices of different perspectives and using different vocabularies.


### TaDiRAH - Taxonomy of Digital Research Activities in the Humanities

http://tadirah.dariah.eu/vocab/index.php

This taxonomy of digital research activities in the humanities has been developed for use by community-driven sites and projects that aim to structure information relevant to digital humanities and make it more easily discoverable. The taxonomy is expected to be particularly useful to endeavors aiming to collect information on digital humanities tools, methods, projects, or readings. See https://github.com/dhtaxonomy for further information.

### Linked Science Core Vocabulary Specification

http://linkedscience.org/lsc/ns/

The Core LSC definitions presented here are written using a computer language (RDF/OWL) that makes it easy for software to process some basic facts about the terms in the Linked Science Core Vocabulary, and consequently about the things described using LSC.
