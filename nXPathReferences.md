## Spécifications XPath

cf. https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath

* 1999, [XML Path Language (XPath) Version 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116/)

  XPath is a language for addressing parts of an XML document, designed to be used by both XSLT and XPointer.

* 2010, [XML Path Language (XPath) 2.0 (Second Edition)](http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/REC-xpath20-20101214/)
  XPath is a way to refer to parts  of an XML document. XPath 2.0 is based on the XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0  Data Model (XDM), and also introduces Schema awareness and data typing.

* 2014, [XML Path Language (XPath) 3.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-xpath-30-20140408/)

  XPath 3.0 (renamed from XPath 2.1 to align with the family of "3.0"  specifications) is an expression language that allows the processing of  values conforming to the data model defined in [XQuery and XPath Data  Model (XDM) 3.0]. Some of the important new features since XPath 2.0  are: 

  - Literal function items, inline functions, dynamic function invocations, and function item coercion
  - Clarification of rules associated with sequence type matching
  - let expressions
  - EQNames (QNames with a namespace URI instead of a namespace prefix)
  - Support for union types in casting and function arguments

* 2017, [XML Path Language (XPath) 3.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-xpath-31-20170321/)

  XPath is an expression language that allows the processing of values conforming to the data model defined in the XQuery and Xpath Data Model.
