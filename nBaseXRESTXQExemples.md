https://mailman.uni-konstanz.de/pipermail/basex-talk/2017-July/012142.html

My/our workaround is to branch in a single XQuery function using sth. like:

```xquery
if (some $a in tokenize(request:header("ACCEPT"), ',') satisfies $a = 
('text/xml', 'application/xml')) then $xml else $xhtml
```

To process https://duckduckgo.com?q=BaseX

```xquery
declare
  %rest:path("/list/{$category}")
  %rest:query-param("page:category", "{$page-category}")
  %output:method("html")
function page:list(
  $page:category as xs:string,
  $page-category as xs:string?
) {
  (: etc :)
};
```

Hi Steve,

A rather late reply to [1] (but maybe better than fully ignore it): We

have fully revised our quality factor handling. The best RESTXQ

function candidates will now be chosen in multiple steps, and your old

use case (with wildcard content types) should now work as expected. If

you still want to give a try, your feedback is welcome [2].

Best,

Christian

Hi Omar, hi Emmanuel,

BaseX 9 will provide support for server-side quality factors [1,2]:
With these extensions, it will eventually be possible to handle cases
in which a client provides no content types, and in which multiple
RESTXQ conflicting functions exist for that request.

Hope this helps,
Christian
