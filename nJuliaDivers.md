## Notebook IJulia

https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl

> **IJulia** is a [Julia-language](http://julialang.org/) backend combined with the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) interactive environment (also used by [IPython](http://ipython.org/)).  This combination allows you to interact with the Julia language using Jupyter/IPython's powerful [graphical notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), which combines code, formatted text, math, and multimedia in a single document. IJulia is a Jupyter language kernel and works with a variety of notebook user interfaces. In addition to the classic Jupyter Notebook, IJulia also works with [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a Jupyter-based integrated development environment for notebooks and code. The [nteract notebook desktop](https://nteract.io/) supports IJulia with detailed instructions for its [installation with nteract](https://nteract.io/kernels/julia).

```julia
add IJulia
```

```julia
using IJulia
notebook()
```

Si Jupyter n’est pas installer, l’installer.
