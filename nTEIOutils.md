### TextAlign

> The Text Alignment Network (TAN) is a suite of highly regulated XML formats designed to maximize the syntactic and semantic interoperability of texts, annotations, and language resources.
> TAN is particularly suited to aligning texts with multiple versions (copies, translations, paraphrases), and to annotating quotations, translation clusters (word-to-word), and lexicomorphological features. Simple, modular, and networked, the TAN format allows users, working independently and collaboratively, to find, create, edit, study, align, and share their texts and annotations. The extensive validation rules are integrated into a library of functions that definitively interpret the format and provide a foundation for third-party tools and applications.
> Although expressive of scholarly nuance and complexity, the TAN format has been designed to benefit everyone, scholars and non-scholars alike, and can be used broadly for reading, teaching, publishing, research, analysis, and language learning.

### TextPair

> TextPAIR is a scalable and high-performance sequence aligner for  humanities text analysis designed to identify "similar passages" in  large collections of texts. These may include direct quotations,  plagiarism and other forms of borrowings, commonplace expressions and  the like. It is a complete rewrite of the [original implementation](https://code.google.com/archive/p/text-pair/) released in 2009. See the [official annoucement on our blog ](https://artfl.blogspot.com/2018/12/textpair-new-high-performance-sequence.html)for details on this new implementation.

### Tracer

Marco Büchler (dir), eTRAP 

> TRACER is a suite of 700 algorithms,  whose features can be combined to create the optimal formula for  detecting those words, sentences and ideas that have been reused across  texts. Created by Marco Büchler, TRACER is designed to facilitate  research in text reuse detection and many have made use of it to  identify plagiarism in a text, as well as *verbatim* and *near verbatim* quotations, paraphrase and even allusions. The thousands of feature  combinations that TRACER supports allow to investigate not only  contemporary texts, but also complex **historical texts** where reuse is harder to spot.
