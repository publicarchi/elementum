## NLP avec Python

- We recommend NLTK only as an education and research tool. Its  modularized structure makes it excellent for learning and exploring NLP  concepts, but it’s not meant for production.
- TextBlob is built on top of NLTK, and it’s more easily-accessible.  This is our favorite library for fast-prototyping or building  applications that don’t require highly optimized performance. *Beginners should start here.*
- Stanford’s CoreNLP is a Java library with Python wrappers. It’s in many existing production systems due to its speed.
- SpaCy is a new NLP library that’s designed to be fast, streamlined,  and production-ready. It’s not as widely adopted, but if you’re building  a new application, you should give it a try.
- Gensim is most commonly used for topic modeling and similarity  detection. It’s not a general-purpose NLP library, but for the tasks it  does handle, it does them well.
