[**tensorflow**](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) — an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. This flexible architecture lets you deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device without rewriting code. TensorFlow also includes TensorBoard, a data visualization toolkit.

[**The Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing (NUPIC)**](https://github.com/numenta/nupic) is a machine intelligence platform that implements the [HTM learning algorithms](http://numenta.com/learn/hierarchical-temporal-memory-white-paper.html). HTM is a detailed computational theory of the neocortex. At the core of HTM are time-based continuous learning algorithms that store and recall spatial and temporal patterns. NuPIC is suited to a variety of problems, particularly anomaly detection and prediction of streaming data sources.

[**Universe**](https://github.com/openai/universe) is a software platform for measuring and training an AI’s general intelligence across the world’s supply of games, websites and other applications. This is the `universe` open-source library, which provides a simple [Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) interface to each Universe environment.

[**Theano**](https://github.com/Theano/Theano) — a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. It can use GPUs and perform efficient symbolic differentiation.

[**keras**](https://github.com/fchollet/keras) — a high-level neural networks library, written in Python and capable of running on top of either [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) or [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano). It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.
