Traits of a good faceted search interface:

1. No empty results set 
   Since the subcategories available are updated each time the user selects a category, navigation always produces results. A zeroresult set exists only if the free-text search feature is used.
2. Magnitude is indicated 
   Each of the category values is followed by a figure in parentheses showing the number of items in the collection possessing that value. Providing insight into the size of a subset helps the user make navigational decisions.
3. Multiple navigation routes 
   People can select values in any order, enabling them to reach the same goal in many different ways.
4. Values may be deselected 
   Because facets are mutually exclusive, they may be recombined. If unsatisfied with the current results, visitors can deselect any value or any combination of values from a facet, thereby expanding the list of results.
5. Familiar web-based experience 
   Such an interface mimics web navigation closely: clicking a link transitions to a new page. Visitors can drill down through categories naturally.

Zappos is definitely one of the better examples of faceted search interfaces, amazon and yelp are good too.
