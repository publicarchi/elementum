### W3C validators

For over 15 years, the W3C has been developing and hosting [**free** and **open source** tools](http://w3c.github.io/developers/) used every day by **millions of Web developers and Web designers**. All the tools listed below are Web-based, and are available as downloadable sources or as free services on the [W3C Developers tools ](http://w3c.github.io/developers/tools/)site.

#### W3C Validator

The [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) checks the [markup validity](http://validator.w3.org/docs/help.html#validation_basics) of various Web document formats, such as HTML.

#### CSS Validator

The [CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) checks Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and (X)HTML documents that use CSS stylesheets.

#### Unicorn

[Unicorn](http://validator.w3.org/unicorn/) is W3C's unified validator, which helps people improve the quality of their Web pages by performing a variety of checks. Unicorn gathers the results of the popular HTML and CSS validators, as well as other useful services, such as RSS/Atom feeds and http headers.

#### Link Checker

The [W3C Link Checker](http://validator.w3.org/checklink) looks for issues in links, anchors and referenced objects in a Web page, CSS style sheet, or recursively on a whole Web site. For best results, it is recommended to first ensure that the documents checked use valid [(X)HTML Markup](http://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

#### Internationalization Checker

The [W3C Internationalization Checker](https://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/) provides information about various internationalization-related aspects of your page, including the HTTP headers that affect it. It will also report a number of  issues and offer advice about how to resolve them.

### The W3C cheatsheet

The [W3C cheatsheet](http://www.w3.org/2009/cheatsheet/) provides quick access to useful information from a variety of specifications published by W3C. It aims at giving in a very compact and mobile-friendly format a compilation of useful knowledge extracted from W3C specifications, completed by summaries of guidelines developed at W3C, in particular Web accessibility guidelines, the Mobile Web Best Practices, and a number of internationalization tips.
