## Sites qui utilisent BaseX

- Old Books _dot_ Org - https://www.fromoldbooks.org/ - incorporate some content generated by
  XQuery, and many of the pages are entirely generated at runtime by XQuery, using BaseX.
  
- The Dictionary of Irish Language from Old and Middle Irish Sources
  (http://www.dil.ie/) has used it for six or more years.  As you can
  imagine, it does not change very often so it is mostly used for searching than updating and the project is very happy with BaseX.
